# Java / Kotlin Speechly API

See the generic [Speechly gRPC stubs documentation](https://github.com/speechly/api) for more information about using the API.

## Install

The API is packaged and distributed in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.speechly/api), so all you need to do is add a dependency to `com.speechly:api`.

In Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.speechly</groupId>
  <artifactId>api</artifactId>
  <version>${speechly.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

and in gradle:

```sh
implementation "com.speechly:api:$speechly.version"
```
